   <h1> I like to read Brian's winter </h1>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p> I like to read Brian's winter because it is about a kid who is stuck in a forset and how he gets along with his new life. It has suspense and talks about it in a narrator way.</p>

    <h2> I also like to read the hardy boys</h2>

    <br> 
    <p> I like to read the hardy boy's because they have suspense too and they are detectives who goes with their dad (a real detective)  and solves crimes like missing gold or theifs in a clif.</p>
